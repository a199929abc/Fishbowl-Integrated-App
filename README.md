### Format Issue
Correct format :
1. SN and DI exist. SN is in the front of DI :  "**EtherTek RMS-300 Monitor, SN: 00-50-C2-53-89-AC, DI: 24368**"
2. SN and DI exist. DI is in the front of SN :  "**EtherTek RMS-300 Monitor, DI: 24368 SN: 00-50-C2-53-89-AC**"
3. ONLY DI exist : "**EtherTek RMS-300 Monitor, DI: 24368**"
4. ONLY SN exist : "**EtherTek RMS-300 Monitor, SN: 00-50-C2-53-89-AC**"
5. DI and SN don't exist : "**EtherTek RMS-300 Monitor**"
6. (Update) SN exist DI is pending : "**EtherTek RMS-300 Monitor, SN: 00-50-C2-53-89-AC DI: Pending**"  "pending" is Capital insensitive can be any format


Error might show up to case below: 
1. "EtherTek RMS-300 Monitor, SN 00-50-C2-53-89-AC, DI: 24368" Reason : "SN:" tag missing ":" can be add to fishbowl client
2. "EtherTek RMS-300 Monitor, SN: 00-50-C2-53-89-AC, DI 24368" Reason : "DI:" tag missing ":" can be add to fishbowl client
3. "EtherTek RMS-300 Monitor, SN: 00-50-C2-53-89-AC, DI: " Reason : After "DI: " tag missing value. If you don't know the DI, add "Pending" 
4. "EtherTek RMS-300 Monitor, SN : 00-50-C2-53-89-AC, DI: Pending" Reason ： EXTRA SPACE in "SN :", should be "SN:" DI might have similar issuse
5. More cases can be discovered in the Fishbowl client. If you are not sure where is the mistake, FOLLOW THE CORRECT format and modify the description
